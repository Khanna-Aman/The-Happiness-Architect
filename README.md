# The Happiness Architect

**Attention & Action is all You Need**  
*Build your Happiness Infrastructure, and Success will Build Itself.*

## About the Project
The Happiness Architect is not another book of theories to sit on your shelf.  
It is an action-first workbook that closes the frustrating knowing–doing gap.  
Think of it as an active construction site where you are the architect and your life is the masterpiece.

The workbook guides you through six weeks of practice, helping you design, test, and live your own happiness infrastructure with tools that blend science, mindfulness, coaching frameworks, and practical exercises.

## Core Philosophy
- Happiness is not found — it is built.  
- Success is not chased — it emerges once you lay the right foundations.  
- Your life is a blueprint. With daily habits as your bricks and reflection as your scaffolding, you can construct a joyful, resilient, and meaningful life.
